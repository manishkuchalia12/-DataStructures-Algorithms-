# 📘 DSA  Practice by Manish Kuchalia
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository! 🚀
Here, I have uploaded  DSA problem solutions, organized by topic and difficulty level.
This journey is focused on mastering coding interviews and sharpening problem-solving skills one day at a time 💪.
This repository contains solutions to common DSA problems in Java.

# ✌️explanation of .java and .class files
✅ A .java file is the source code file — the code you write in Java.
🧠 This .class file is not human-readable — it contains instructions that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) understands.
    Java compiler (javac) translates our code into bytecode.

# 📌 What You’ll Find Here
🔹 Well-structured solutions to DSA problems
🔹 Categorized by topic (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, etc.)
🔹 Code written with readability and clarity
🔹 Some problems include time and space complexity analysis
